Changes since v1.3
==================

o Centralised the parsing of lines in guide entries in a class hierarchy for
  handling parsing (see wegLibNGLineParser.pas).

o Replaced the parsing code in the entry viewer control with a call to one
  of the above classes.

o The non-colour mode of the entry viewer now paints monochrome versions of
  the main control codes (bold, underline, reverse).

o Replaced the guide entry control code stripping code with a call to one of
  the line parser classes.

Changes since v1.2
==================

o Added a function to TwegLibNortonGuide that lets you check if a given
  offset looks like a short or long entry.

Changes since v1.1
==================

o Fixed some OEM to ANSI problems with menus and see also lists. This should
  fix a problem that "ZaG" reported with Russian language guides.

Changes since v1.0
==================

o Fixed the navigation checking functions in TwegLibNGEntryViewer so that
  they don't assume that there is an entry object available all of the time.
  This fixes a bug found by Douglas Woodrow.
