Changes since v1.1
==================

o Fixed some OEM to ANSI problems with menus and see also lists. This should
  fix a problem that "ZaG" reported with Russian language guides.

Changes since v1.0
==================

o Fixed the navigation checking functions in TwegLibNGEntryViewer so that
  they don't assume that there is an entry object available all of the time.
  This fixes a bug found by Douglas Woodrow.
