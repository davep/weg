Changes since v1.11
===================

o Published the OnDragOver and OnDragDrop events of the entry viewer
  component.

Changes since v1.10
===================

o Added the TypeName property to TwegLibNGEntry.

o Made TwegLibNGEntryViewer.hasEntry() public.

o Added the BOLSearchFirstInShorts property to the TwegLibNGEntryFind
  component. Setting this to True makes the search system work something
  similar to the search system in the original NG.exe.

Changes since v1.9
==================

o Modified the line parsing code so that if a colour attribute is in effect
  and a new attribute marker of the same value is seen it reverts to the
  normal text colour.

o Modified the TFileStream oriented functions in wegLibUtils.pas so that
  they work on a TStream instead of a TFileStream.

o Modified the Entry, Menu and See-Also classes so that they work on TStream
  rather than TFileStream.

o Increased the max read line length from 512 to 1024 to stay consistent
  with the limits mentioned in the Expert Help Compiler manual.

o Limited the max number of read see-also entries to 20 to stay consistent
  with the limits mentioned in the Expert Help Compiler manual. This change
  also helps guard against corrupt guides.

Changes since v1.8 
==================

o Modified the entry viewer component so that it doesn't create and free a
  painter for each draw action. Instead just create the painters once and
  reuse them.

o Modified the entry class so that it doesn't create and free a line
  stripper object for each line in the entry. Instead just create the
  stripper once and reuse it.

o Modified wegLibExpand() so that it tries to do something sensible if an
  author of a guide has used two consecutive "hard spaces" (which would
  result in 255 spaces being inserted when the author probably wanted two
  consecutive spaces).

Changes since v1.7
==================

o Added a TimeStamp property to the Norton Guide class.

o Modified the back-track history so that it only adds the current location
  to the history if the new location is different from the current location
  (including the highlighted line).

Changes since v1.6
==================

o Added the entryPath() method to the entry viewer component.

o Added the entryTitle() method to the entry viewer component.

o Increased the max length of a menu and see-also title.

Changes since v1.5
==================

o Improved the code in the entry viewer that worked out how wide a
  horizontal scrollbar should be.

o Improved the code in the entry viewer that worked out how tall an a line
  is for a given font.

o The global finder now records the title of the guide as well as the name
  of the file.
  
Changes since v1.4
==================

o The entry viewer now properly checks that a given offset is a real short
  or long entry.

o Fixed a bug in the line parser that would cause some parts of some lines
  to not observe the current OEMToANSI setting.

Changes since v1.3
==================

o Centralised the parsing of lines in guide entries in a class hierarchy for
  handling parsing (see wegLibNGLineParser.pas).

o Replaced the parsing code in the entry viewer control with a call to one
  of the above classes.

o The non-colour mode of the entry viewer now paints monochrome versions of
  the main control codes (bold, underline, reverse).

o Replaced the guide entry control code stripping code with a call to one of
  the line parser classes.

o Exposed the OnKeyPress property of TwegLibNGEntryViewer.

Changes since v1.2
==================

o Added a function to TwegLibNortonGuide that lets you check if a given
  offset looks like a short or long entry.

Changes since v1.1
==================

o Fixed some OEM to ANSI problems with menus and see also lists. This should
  fix a problem that "ZaG" reported with Russian language guides.

Changes since v1.0
==================

o Fixed the navigation checking functions in TwegLibNGEntryViewer so that
  they don't assume that there is an entry object available all of the time.
  This fixes a bug found by Douglas Woodrow.
