Things TODO to WEG:
===================

o DDE server support (was in WEG 1.x).

o Printing support (was in WEG 1.x).

o Associating .NG files doesn't work so well with WEG now that it is an MDI
  application. Come up with a method of ensuring that files passed on the
  command line get opened in a previously running instance of WEG if such an
  instance exists.

o URL scanner (was in WEG 1.x)
