Changes since v2.2
==================

o Removed the maximise and minimise buttons from the guide credits dialog.

o Added bookmarks.

o Added an extra check when loading a guide on startup that ensures that the
  entry we're supposed to be loading is still valid. This fixes a bug
  reported by Martin Verheij.

Changes since v2.1
==================

Built against v1.2 of WEGLib.

Changes since v2.0
==================

Built against v1.1 of WEGLib.

Changes since v1.0.15
=====================

WEG 2.0 is a ground-up re-write of WEG, as such everything has changed. Some
of the more significant changes since WEG v1.0.15 are:

o Large parts of WEG are now implemented in a library for Delphi called
  WEGLib. If you're so inclined you can use WEGLib to develop your own
  Norton Guide reader (be sure to understand the licence before you do).

o On machines that have the VBScript regular expression class installed you
  can do regular expression searching.

o WEG is now an MDI application.

o Every aspect of the colour setup is now configurable by the user.

o WEG now uses a proper installer.

o Guide menus and see-also lists are now proper menus (WEG 1.x used a tree
  to navigate guides).

However, please also note that, as of the time of writing, I've not yet
implemented some of the facilities that existed in WEG 1.x. Please see
TODO.txt for a list of these facilities. If you need these facilities you
should probably keep WEG 1.x installed on your machine for a while longer.
