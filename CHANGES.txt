Changes since v2.9
==================

o The file save dialog used for saving source didn't do an overwrite prompt
  check. Fixed.

o Ensured that the edit control in the in-entry find dialog gets focus and
  that the content is highlighted when the dialog is re-focused.

o When a search finishes in the global finder the status bar now tells you
  how many items were found and how long the search took.

Changes since v2.8
==================

o You can now drag a guide from the guide manager and drop it on the
  background of the main window to open a guide.

o You can now drag a bookmark from the bookmark window and drop it on the
  background of the main window to open a bookmark.

o You can now drag a hit from the global finder and drop it on the
  background of the main window to open the hit.

o Implemented a "search" macro for the DDE support.

o Added a clear facility to the bookmarks window.

Changes since v2.7
==================

o Added physical information about a guide to the guide information dialog.

o The see also menu of a guide entry will, where possible, include any URLs
  found in the entry in the see-also menu. When you select such an item from
  the menu the URL will be passed to the operating system so that your URL
  handler of choice is used.

o Added a DDE server and implemented the "open" macro.

o Changed the file associations in the installer so that DDE is used. This
  means that a single instance of WEG can be used to handle open requests
  via file associations in Windows.

o Renamed the main "Edit" menu to "Options".

o Added a window recycling option to the global finder.

o Added a window recycling option to the guide manager.

o Added a window recycling option for opening guides file the file/open menu
  option.

o Added a window recycling option for opening guides file the file/reopen
  menu option.

o Added a window recycling option for opening guides via DDE.

o Added a window recycling option for opening guides via the command line.

o Added a window recycling option for opening guides via drag and drop.

o The entry find dialog now gives up focus to the guide window when a find
  option has happened.

Changes since v2.6
==================

o Built with Toolbar2000 v2.1.4.

o The compatibility keystroke for pulling up the guide information should
  have been "?", not "v". Changed.

o Made sure that any "&" in the title of a menu from a guide is escaped so
  as not to be confused with a Windows' menu accelerator key.

o Made the first letter of each main menu title from a guide into an
  accelerator key. This could cause clashes with other accelerator keys but,
  if someone is trying to use just the keyboard, they're probably more
  interested in getting at the guide's menu that any of the other menus.

o The bookmark manager now makes a better guess at a default title for a
  bookmark.

o The guide printing code now makes a better guess at a good title for a
  print job.

o Added short-cuts for each of the window oriented menu items.

Changes since v2.5
==================

o The global finder now tells you -- in the status bar and as a hint -- the
  name of the guide that a hit was found in.

o WEG now remembers if the guide manager, bookmarks manager or the global
  finder windows were open and when you next run WEG opens them for you.

Changes since v2.4
==================

o Changed printing support so that it only prints selected text if there is
  a selection available.

Changes since v2.3
==================

o Added a "right-click" menu to the bookmarks window.

o Added printing support.

o Added support for many of the keystrokes that were supported by the DOS,
  GNU/Linux and OS/2 versions of EG. This support was also in WEG 1.x and
  I'd forgotten to add it to WEG 2.x.

Changes since v2.2
==================

o Removed the maximise and minimise buttons from the guide credits dialog.

o Added bookmarks.

o Added an extra check when loading a guide on startup that ensures that the
  entry we're supposed to be loading is still valid. This fixes a bug
  reported by Martin Verheij.

Changes since v2.1
==================

Built against v1.2 of WEGLib.

Changes since v2.0
==================

Built against v1.1 of WEGLib.

Changes since v1.0.15
=====================

WEG 2.0 is a ground-up re-write of WEG, as such everything has changed. Some
of the more significant changes since WEG v1.0.15 are:

o Large parts of WEG are now implemented in a library for Delphi called
  WEGLib. If you're so inclined you can use WEGLib to develop your own
  Norton Guide reader (be sure to understand the licence before you do).

o On machines that have the VBScript regular expression class installed you
  can do regular expression searching.

o WEG is now an MDI application.

o Every aspect of the colour setup is now configurable by the user.

o WEG now uses a proper installer.

o Guide menus and see-also lists are now proper menus (WEG 1.x used a tree
  to navigate guides).

However, please also note that, as of the time of writing, I've not yet
implemented some of the facilities that existed in WEG 1.x. Please see
TODO.txt for a list of these facilities. If you need these facilities you
should probably keep WEG 1.x installed on your machine for a while longer.
