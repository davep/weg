Changes since v2.6
==================

o Built with Toolbar2000 v2.1.4.

o The compatibility keystroke for pulling up the guide information should
  have been "?", not "v". Changed.

o Made sure that any "&" in the title of a menu from a guide is escaped so
  as not to be confused with a Windows' menu accelerator key.

o Made the first letter of each main menu title from a guide into an
  accelerator key. This could cause clashes with other accelerator keys but,
  if someone is trying to use just the keyboard, they're probably more
  interested in getting at the guide's menu that any of the other menus.

o The bookmark manager now makes a better guess at a default title for a
  bookmark.

o The guide printing code now makes a better guess at a good title for a
  print job.

o Added short-cuts for each of the window oriented menu items.

Changes since v2.5
==================

o The global finder now tells you -- in the status bar and as a hint -- the
  name of the guide that a hit was found in.

o WEG now remembers if the guide manager, bookmarks manager or the global
  finder windows were open and when you next run WEG opens them for you.

Changes since v2.4
==================

o Changed printing support so that it only prints selected text if there is
  a selection available.

Changes since v2.3
==================

o Added a "right-click" menu to the bookmarks window.

o Added printing support.

o Added support for many of the keystrokes that were supported by the DOS,
  GNU/Linux and OS/2 versions of EG. This support was also in WEG 1.x and
  I'd forgotten to add it to WEG 2.x.

Changes since v2.2
==================

o Removed the maximise and minimise buttons from the guide credits dialog.

o Added bookmarks.

o Added an extra check when loading a guide on startup that ensures that the
  entry we're supposed to be loading is still valid. This fixes a bug
  reported by Martin Verheij.

Changes since v2.1
==================

Built against v1.2 of WEGLib.

Changes since v2.0
==================

Built against v1.1 of WEGLib.

Changes since v1.0.15
=====================

WEG 2.0 is a ground-up re-write of WEG, as such everything has changed. Some
of the more significant changes since WEG v1.0.15 are:

o Large parts of WEG are now implemented in a library for Delphi called
  WEGLib. If you're so inclined you can use WEGLib to develop your own
  Norton Guide reader (be sure to understand the licence before you do).

o On machines that have the VBScript regular expression class installed you
  can do regular expression searching.

o WEG is now an MDI application.

o Every aspect of the colour setup is now configurable by the user.

o WEG now uses a proper installer.

o Guide menus and see-also lists are now proper menus (WEG 1.x used a tree
  to navigate guides).

However, please also note that, as of the time of writing, I've not yet
implemented some of the facilities that existed in WEG 1.x. Please see
TODO.txt for a list of these facilities. If you need these facilities you
should probably keep WEG 1.x installed on your machine for a while longer.
