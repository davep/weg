Known WEG bugs:
===============

o On some systems, depending on font DPI choice, the initial font choice
  causes the guide entry display to show the text with the bottom part of
  each line truncated. This is most likely down to me not correctly
  calculating the correct height of a line in the TListBox descendant class
  that displays the guide entry (currently I'm using a "20% trick" that's
  worked with WEG for years). Until a fix is found I suggest you pick a font
  that works for you once you've installed WEG.
